## Dependencies

In addition to those dependency crates listed in Cargo.toml Akula also has implicit dependencies on:

- Rust/Cargo (unstable)
- pkgconfig
- clang
- libclang
- e2fsprogs
- protobuf

The latter two being used by the builds of some of Akula's dependencies.

### Building with Nix

A hermetic build/development shell environment is provided in `flake.nix` via the [nix](https://nixos.org/) package manager. It provides fixed versions of the implicit dependencies above as well as the correct version of Rust as defined in the rust `./rust-toolchain` file. You can enter the environment by running:

```shell
# Will download necessary dependencies including Rust nightly and enter a development environment where they are available
nix develop
# Dependency are now available for:
cargo build
cargo test
```
