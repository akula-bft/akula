## Building the source

Install `rustup` from rustup.rs.

```
git clone https://github.com/akula-bft/akula

cd akula

cargo build --all --profile=production
```

You can find built binaries in `target/production` folder.

## Running

* `akula` takes an _already synced_ [Erigon](https://github.com/ledgerwatch/erigon) database with downloaded blocks and headers (stages 1-3), imports them, executes and verifies state root:

```
akula --datadir=<path to Akula database directory> --erigon-datadir=<path to Erigon database directory>
```

* `akula-toolbox` provides various helper commands to check and manipulate Akula's database. Please consult its help for more info:
```
akula-toolbox --help
```
